⚠️ Highly experimental ⚠️

>If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it. ~ Lord Kelvin

Ego but female, because all AI assistants are female.

The goal is to implement tools that

1. Collect data about your inputs
2. Collect data about your outputs
3. Provide tools to run life experiments and interpret

See [issues](https://github.com/louis030195/ega/issues) for discussing ideas.

## Desired API

```py
EXPERIMENT_NAME="dopamine_fast" make fn/experiment/start
make fn/experiment/stop
```

## Why?

- Collecting & joining private data as a product is not culturally acceptable
